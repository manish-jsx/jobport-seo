                                    <p><em>It is becoming increasingly difficult to predict what workplace requirements
                                            of the future will be. As the digital revolution intensifies, the job market
                                            of the future can no longer be based on the circumstances of the past.
                                            Artificial intelligence is able to replace humans in so many tasks and many
                                            more humans are being pushed out of the job market as a result.Â At the same
                                            time, new jobs are being created.</em></p>

                                    <p>It is generally agreed that most of what our kids are learning in school today
                                        will probably be irrelevant by the time they are in their late thirties, and the
                                        biggest educational dilemma of our times is what to teach in schools if we donât
                                        really know what the job market of the future will require.<em>Â Â </em></p>

                                    <p>All we know is that the future of work is characterised by change, and job
                                        training will need to respond accordingly...</p>

                                    <h4>Job training that embraces change as a constant</h4>

                                    <p>The job market has always been defined by change, and it has always been through
                                        training that the needs and expectations of the job market have been met.
                                        However, the rate of change has accelerated considerably in recent times. Now,
                                        more than ever, job training needs to respond to current demands with an eye on
                                        future trends. The more job training embraces change, with an eye on the future,
                                        the more will it manage to respond to the constantly evolving demands of a
                                        productive and profitable workforce.Â Â <br />
                                        Â </p>

                                    <h4><strong>Acknowledging that the traditional method of job training is
                                            obsolete</strong></h4>

                                    <p><br />
                                        Traditionally life has been divided into 2 parts â a period of learning followed
                                        by a period of working. The period of learning was characterised by identity
                                        building and skills acquisition in preparation for the future, while the period
                                        of working signified the realisation of a stable identity with the required
                                        skills to start navigating a financially stable future and becoming an active
                                        citizen. This no longer suffices. Â </p>

                                    <p>Job training and the upskilling of employees have extended the period of learning
                                        into the period of working. It is only through ongoing training that current and
                                        future exigencies of the job market can be met. There may be some organisations
                                        that still do not offer job-related training and still operate through the
                                        traditional method of job training. But fortunately, this is not the case for
                                        most organisations as it is now recognised that training and upskilling is not
                                        only necessary to survive into the future, it is also a way to care for and
                                        retain employees.</p>

                                    <h4><strong>Embracing a flexible work identity</strong></h4>

                                    <p>Discourse has started to center on career changes and how to negotiate them
                                        successfully. Â According to Microsoftâs Work Trend Index â <em>a global survey
                                            of over 30,000 people in 31 countries shows that more than 40% of
                                            respondents said they are considering leaving their employer this year.</em>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>There is much that is unknown about the future of the work landscape, but the
                                        starting point is that a stable identity, a stable job, and a stable worldview
                                        are no longer the goals of future job training.Â </p>

                                    <p>No young person undertaking a course of studies or embarking on a new job can
                                        safely assume it will remain the same throughout oneâs working life. On the
                                        contrary, instability or more appropriately a constant state of flux needs to be
                                        embraced. Â </p>

                                    <p><strong>Defining the required skills for a flexible work identity</strong></p>

                                    <p>Future job seekers who are prepared for a flexible work identity are more likely
                                        to be resilient, balanced, and able to deal with stress. <a
                                            href="https://thinktalent.com.mt/self-development/">The best investment is
                                            in emotional intelligence and mental balance</a>. These are the skills that
                                        will prepare workers of the future to keep changing and learning throughout
                                        life.Â Â </p>

                                    <p>Additionally, the transfer of information will no longer take precedence. Before
                                        it was necessary because not everyone had access to information, but nowadays,
                                        living as we do in the information era, perhaps the most important skill in
                                        regard to information is knowing how to sift and sort through information so as
                                        to be more focused and in possession of the tools to construct reality and truth
                                        from the information available.</p>

                                    <h4><strong>Understanding the dynamics of change</strong></h4>

                                    <p>Even as the traditional method of job training is rejected and the required
                                        skills for a flexible work identity are acquired, there needs to be an
                                        understanding that none of this will be enough. Future job seekers will also
                                        need to develop the ability to <a href="lifelong-learning.html">keep changing
                                            and learning throughout their lives</a>.Â Â </p>

                                    <p>This resonates very deeply with the concept of lifelong learning and what Ken
                                        Robinson describes as <em>the organic process of education, whereby education is
                                            translated in the creation of spaces and conditions where people continue to
                                            flourish and grow throughout their lives.</em></p>

                                    <h4><strong>Forging closer links between academia and business
                                            organisations</strong></h4>

                                    <p>This is needed so that learners in the workplace or yet to move into the
                                        workplace keep pace with the changing needs of the workforce.Â Â </p>

                                    <p>It will also help education providers to continuously add more content on future
                                        trends and technologies and to help future employees/leaders think critically
                                        about future opportunities and the range of skills they will need to navigate an
                                        AI future.</p>

                                    <p>An important metaphor on how job training for the future contrasts with that of
                                        the past has aptly been presented by the eminent author and historian, Yuval
                                        Noah Harari.Â Â He describes previous education and job training as <em>building a
                                            house with very deep foundations. Nowadays, he likens training for the
                                            future of work to a tent that you can fold up and move to another location
                                            very quickly and easily.</em>Â Â </p>

                                    <p><strong>Future jobseekers will need to be confident with working arrangements
                                            that are not necessarily long-term and with <a
                                                href="transferable-skills-what-are-they-and-how-can-you-benefit-from-them.html">transferable
                                                skills</a> that will enable them to move into alternative jobs more
                                            easily and across the duration of their entire working lives.</strong></p>

                                    <p><em><strong>It may well be that the era of the Great Resignation that we are
                                                currently witnessing is already serving as the prologue of this grand
                                                narrative that is about to unfold. </strong></em></p>

                                    <p><em><strong>Bottom line â itâs going to be an open attitude to change and
                                                appropriate responses to counter such change that will adequately
                                                prepare current and future generations of job seekers.</strong></em></p>
