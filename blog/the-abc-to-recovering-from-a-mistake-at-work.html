                                            sometimes we do.  </strong></p>

                                    <p>To what extent our mistake at work will tarnish our reputation is very much

                                    <p>Mistakes can break us. The extent of the damage and the motives behind it might
                                        even cost us our job. But a mistake can also make us - because it will reveal
                                        who we really are when the chips are down... </p>

                                    <h4>A – Admit your mistake</h4>

                                    <p><strong>As soon as it happens, admit that you made a mistake.</strong></p>

                                    <p>Perhaps the first person you need to admit it to is yourself.  All too often
                                        panic strikes and there is a rush to make hasty amends in an effort to rectify
                                        the mistake. This might work sometimes, but most of the time, it just makes the
                                        situation worse.  Like rushing to remove a stain, not using the right products,
                                        and just making the stain look bigger and worse.  Staying calm is difficult but
                                        key. Self-admittance comes with the realisation that nobody can be perfect all
                                        the time, and we all make mistakes.</p>

                                    <p><strong>The next step is admitting to your colleagues and superiors.  </strong>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The gravity of the mistake will indicate to what level you will need to report.
                                        This again is a time to stay composed and thinking in advance about your best
                                        approach. Admitting will also need to come with an apology. <a
                                            href="how-to-work-with-authenticity-at-work.html">This will convey how
                                            genuinely sorry you are</a> for your mistake. No need to be too emotional or
                                        to beat yourself up, because this will stress out those who will need to help
                                        you work through your mistake. Do not postpone owning up to a mistake too long.
                                        Others will notice it, and then it will be very difficult to persuade others
                                        that you were going to admit and apologise for your mistake. And most
                                        importantly, do not apologize for your mistakes over and over again - do it once
                                        and truly mean it. There’s nothing worse than dwelling on something that's
                                        already done.</p>

                                    <h4>B – Blame no one</h4>

                                    <p><strong>Blame is an excellent defense mechanism. </strong></p>

                                    <p>It’s much easier to blame someone else rather than to accept responsibility. But
                                        admitting a mistake means owning up to it as your own mistake. Sometimes the
                                        situation can be a bit blurred here. Is the employee to blame for the mistake?
                                        Or is it the supervisor’s fault for giving incomplete instructions? Who is going
                                        to take ownership of a mistake in such an environment? Will the supervisor lie,
                                        and play the blame game by saying instructions were given correctly but
                                        misinterpreted? Blame is a tool used when in attack mode, as is lying.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Ideally, some mistakes will entail team discussion, so that the fault for
                                            the mistake, if applicable, can be attributed to the whole team rather than
                                            to one individual. </strong></p>

                                    <p>One thing to remember before blaming others is that the more often you play the
                                        blame game, the more you lose.  You need to learn how to own up to the ‘role’
                                        you played in the mistake. Being accountable for one’s own actions is a quality
                                        that can get you noticed at work, even if it's at the expense of making a
                                        mistake that you thought might ruin your reputation.</p>

                                    <h4>C – Correct your mistake</h4>

                                    <p><em><strong>It’s no use crying over spilled milk, but you can at least mop it up
                                                from the floor.  </strong></em></p>

                                    <p>Try to see if you can come up with a plan to rectify your mistake. This will not
                                        be possible in all cases but try to suggest some solutions or give evidence of a
                                        brainstorming exercise that has been carried out to come up with ways to make
                                        amends for the mistake. It’s always good to come up with Plan A and Plan B, even
                                        if your superior might eventually overrule and suggest another way forward. But
                                        your efforts at making amends will not have been lost and they will also serve
                                        to <a href="https://thinktalent.com.mt/self-development/">demonstrate your
                                            problem-solving skills</a>.</p>

                                    <p>Your team may also benefit from solving a mistake together. They say teamwork
                                        makes dream work, and sometimes you just need a fresh perspective to help. All
                                        companies are faced with a crisis at some point, and having workers who can
                                        solve problems is good for the workforce.  </p>

                                    <p>And finally, be prepared to work extra to ensure that you correct your mistake.
                                        Making up for something means that you are ready to give up your time to make
                                        things better. Financially, we may never be able to ‘pay’ for our mistake, but
                                        staying on after work and offering to do that little extra to make amends will
                                        all point towards being genuine with our apology and demonstrate that we are
                                        truly sorry for our mistake.</p>

                                    <p>Back to my first boss and my first mistake. Well, at first, he did seem a bit
                                        annoyed, but my face must have displayed the right degree of remorse. </p>

                                    <p><strong>He told me that it was expected that sometimes I would make a mistake,
                                            just as long as I would be careful in the future, not to make the same
                                            mistake twice. “<a

                                                and lessons are learned</a>”, he ended.  </strong></p>

                                    <p>I never repeated that same mistake again. I also got that promotion when it was
                                        due.</p>
